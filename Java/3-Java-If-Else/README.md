#Problem Statement

Using "if-else" you can perform decision making in Java. See the flowchart below (taken from wikipedia):

This problem will test your knowledge on "if-else" statements.

Given an integer _**N**_ as input, check the following:

If _**N**_ is odd, print _**"Weird"**_.
If _**N**_ is even and, in between the range of 2 and 5(inclusive), print _**"Not Weird"**_.
If _**N**_ is even and, in between the range of 6 and 20(inclusive), print _**"Weird"**_.
If _**N**_ is even and _**N>20**_, print _**"Not Weird"**_.
We given you partially completed code in the editor, complete it to solve the problem.

##Input Format

There is a single line of input: integer _**N**_.

##Constraints 
_**1≤N≤100**_
##Output Format

Print _**"Weird"**_ if the number is weird. Otherwise, print _**"Not Weird"**_. Do not print the quotation marks.
